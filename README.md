## Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself? 

This project is an AI model that is capable of solving a maze game. Specifically, the agent pirate must navigate a maze from start to finish and collect the treasure at the end. This is accomplished by training an AI model, teaching them how to play the game, monitoring the win rate during training, and finally setting them free to play a real game and record their progress. Most of the code provided was boilerplate that set up the specifics regarding the game, the reward structure, and general parameters for training. The code that I wrote myself was the code that iterated through every epoch and step, observed the state of the environment, instructed the AI to make a movement choice, observed the new environment, and fed the results of the AIâ€™s decisions into the model for training and fitting. 

 

## What do computer scientists do and why does it matter? 

At their core, computer scientists are problem solvers. They take a set of requirements and thoroughly analyze them, then begin designing a solution to the given problem. Since computer scientists work with technology, this solution is typically realized as a digital system or application, such as a website, web application, or even an artificial intelligence model.  

The work computer scientists do is important because it quite literally changes humanity. Necessity is the mother of invention and has been the driving force of human advancement since the dawn of time. With the invention of computers in the last couple hundred years, we have been given yet another tool to use to begin solving problems. With recent developments in artificial intelligence, we are now reaching a point where machines may be able to start solving problems for us that we simply have never had the capabilities to solve before, such as those within medicine or medical research. 

 

## How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist? 

As a computer scientist, my first step is to ensure that I understand the problem being described. Without understanding the problem, I cannot possibly hope to arrive at an effective solution. After that, my next step is to determine the exact requirements of the problem. I will break down these requirements into small, measurable steps that assist me through the design and development process of my solution. As I develop my application, I will gradually introduce features that meet these requirements and test them for accuracy. Once all of the requirements are present, functioning, and fully tested, I can then consider my solution to the problem to be completed.  

 

## What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization? 

Computer scientists often work in close proximity to sensitive user data. Consequently, I have several ethical responsibilities to meet in my line of work. I believe that I must never design or implement a system that is actively intended to harm an end user. On the organization side, I believe that I must never knowingly develop something that puts the company at risk, and that I must speak up if I believe that something in the software requirements is illegal or unethical.
